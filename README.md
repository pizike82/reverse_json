# reverse_json
Script for taking an existing .json file using recursion to reverse the paths for each element, so that searching .json files can be mapped out.

But why?

- This was created as a tool, while dealing with very long nested json files

How to use:

- Add link to json file at Line 4

- Run script

- Output file created is "anti_json.json"

*Currently also prints to console
